This program includes several functions:

  Scene control
-----------------------
- f: toggle fullscreen
- g: toggle fog
- s: toggle sea and sky
- w: toggle wire
- q: toggle quit
- t: toggle texture (though not perfect)
- m: toggle mountain

  Camera control

- Page down : slower
- Up Arrow  : move up
- Down Arrow: move down
- Mouse Right: turn right

No other functions are included.
NOTE: You can directly run the project(I guess, I set the additional lib and include to a $SolutionDir/...).
